An Integrated Understander
.A
Schank, R.C.
Lebowitz, M.
Birnbarim, L.
.W
    A new type of natural language parser is presented.  The idea behind
this parser is to map input sentences into the deepest form of the
representation of their meaning and inferences, as is appropriate.  The
parser is not distinct from an entire understanding system.  It uses an
integrated conception of inferences, scripts, plans and other knowledge to
aid in the parse.  Furthermore, it does not attempt to parse everything it
sees.  Rather, it determines what is most interesting and concentrates on
that, ignoring the rest.

discipline be said to be emerging, or is it still an amalgam of skills
from other fields, such as mathematics, engineering, and library
science?  In other words, tell me about information retrieval research.

    This paper notes the benefits accruing from interaction between computerized
retrieval systems and micrographic retrieval systems.  It reviews current state
of automated micrographic retrieval technology.  The conclusion is that with a
combination of advances in communications technology, and sophisticated indexing
input from libraries and information scientists, the new generation of automated
micrographs devices may constitute the on-line document retrieval systems of the

User-Responsive Subject Control in Bibliographic Retrieval Systems
.A
Tague, J.M.
.W
    A study was carried out of the relationship between the vocabulary of
user queries and the vocabulary of documents relevant to the queries, and
the value of adding to the document description record in a retrieval system
keywords from previous queries for which the document had proved useful.
Two test databases incorporating user query keywords were implemented at
the School of Library and Information Science, University of Western
Ontario.  Clustering of the documents via title and user keywords, a
statistical analysis of title-user keyword co-occurrences, and retrieval
tests were used to examine the effect of the added keywords.  Results
showed the impracticality of the procedure in an operational setting, but
indicated the value of analyses with sample data in the development and
maintenance of keyword dictionaries and thesauri.

A Translating Computer Interface for End-User Operation of Heterogeneous
Retrieval Systems.  I. Design
.A
Marcus, R.S.
Reintjes, J.F.
.W
    Online retrieval systems may be difficult to use, especially by end
users, because of heterogeneity and complexity.  Investigations have concerned
the concept of a translating computer interface as a means to simplify access
to, and operation of, heterogeneous bibliographic retrieval systems and
databases.  The interface allows users to make requests in a common language.
These requests are translated by the interface into the appropriate commands
for whatever system is being interrogated.  System responses may also be
transformed by the interface into a common form before being given to the
users.  Thus, the network of different systems is made to look like a single
"virtual" system to the user.  The interface also provides instruction and
other search aids for the user.  The philosophy, design, and implementation
of an experimental interface named CONIT are described.

The Measurement of Term Importance in Automatic Indexing
.A
Salton, G.
Wu, H.
Yu, C.T.
.W
    The frequency characteristics of terms in the documents of a collection
have been used as indicators of term importance for content analysis and
indexing purposes.  In particular, very rare or very frequent terms are
normally believed to be less effective than medium-frequency terms.  Recently
automatic indexing theories have been devised that use not only the term
frequency characteristics but also the relevance properties of the terms.
The major term-weighting theories are first briefly reviewed.  The term
precision and term utility weights that are based on the occurrence
characteristics of the terms in the relevant, as opposed to the nonrelevant,
documents of a collection are then introduced.  Methods are suggested for
estimating the relevance properties of the terms based on their overall
occurrence characteristics in the collection.  Finally, experimental
evaluation results are shown comparing the weighting systems using the term
relevance properties with the more conventional frequency-based methodologies.

Performance Testing of a Book and Its Index as a Information Retrieval
System
.A
Bennion, B.C.
.W
    The retrieval performance of book indexes can be measured in terms of
their ability to direct a user selectively to text material whose identity
but not location is known.  The method requires human searchers to base
their searching strategies on actual passages from the book rather than on
test queries, natural or contrived.  It circumvents the need for relevance
judgement, but still yields performance indicators that correspond
approximately to the recall and precision ratios of large document retrieval
system evaluation.  A preliminary application of the method to the subject
indexing of two major encyclopedias showed one encyclopedia apparently
superior in both the finding and discrimination abilities of retrieval
performance.  The method is presently best suited for comparative testing
since its ability to yield absolute or reproducible measures is as yet not
established.

Fuzzy Requests:  An Approach to Weighted Boolean Searches
.A
Bookstein, A.
.W
    This article concerns the problem of how to permit a patron to
represent the relative importance of various index terms in a Boolean
request while retaining the desirable properties of a Boolean system.
The character of classical Boolean systems is reviewed and related to the
notion of fuzzy sets.  The fuzzy set concept then forms the basis of the
concept of a fuzzy request in which weights are assigned to index terms.
Ther properties of such a system are discussed, and it is shown that such
systems retain the manipulability of traditional Boolean requests.

Experiments in Local Metrical Feedback in Full-Text Retrieval Systems
.A
Attar, R.
Fraenkel, A.S.
.W
    A method of iterative searching, using the results of one iteration search
to formulate the next iteration search, was applied to a full-text database
consisting of some 2400 documents and 1,3000,000 text-words of Hebrew and
Aramaic.  The iterative method consists of clustering the documents returned
in an iteration, using weighting by proximity and by frequency simultaneously.
The process produces searchonyms, which are terms synonymous to keywords in the
context of a single query.  Augumenting or replacing keywords by searchonyms
via manual or automatic feedback leads to the formulation of the next iteration
search.  The results of the experiment are consistent with those of an earlier
small-scale experiment on an English database, and indicate that in contrast
to global clustering where the size of matrices limits applications to small
databases and improvements are doubtful, local metrical methods appear to be
well suited to arbitrarily large databases, improving precision and recall
simultaneously.  Further experiments using more test-queries run on even
larger databases should be made to collect further evidence as to the
performance of these methods.

Partial-Match Retrieval Using Indexed Descriptor Files
.A
Pfaltz, J.L.
Berman, W.J.
Cagley, E.M.
.W
    In this paper we describe a practical method of partial-match retrieval
in very large data files.  A binary code word, called a descriptor, is
associated with each record of the file.  These record descriptors are
then used to form a derived descriptor for a block of several records,
which will serve as an index for the block as a whole; hence, the name
"indexed descriptor files."

    First the structure of these files is described and a simple, efficient
retrieval algorithm is presented.  Then its expected behavior, in terms of
storage accesses, is analyzed in detail.  Two different file creation
procedures are sketched, and a number of ways in which the file organization
can be "tuned" to a particular application is suggested.

A Translating Computer Interface for End-User Operation of

Marcus, R.S.

    The evaluation of the concept of a translating compuyter interface for
simplifying operation of multiple, heterogenous online bibliographic
retrieval systems has been undertaken.  An experimental retrieval system,
named CONIT, was built and tested under controlled conditions with
inexperienced end users.  A detailed analysis of the experimental usages
showed that users were able to master interface operation sufficiently well
to find relevant document references.  Success was attributed, in part,
to a simple command language, adequate online instruction, and a simplified
natural-language, keyword/stem approach to searching.  It is concluded that
operational interfaces of the type studied can provide for increased usability
of existing system in a cost effective manner, especially for searchers.
Furthermore, more advanced interfaces based on improved instruction and
automated search strategy techniques could further enhance retrieval
effectiveness for a wide class of users.

Adaptive Design for Decision Support Systems
.A
Keen, P.G.W.
.W
    Decision Support Systems (DSS) represent a concept of the role of
computers within the decision making process.  The term has become a
rallying cry for researchers, practitioners, and managers concerned that
Management Science and Management Information Systems fields have become
unnecessarily narrow in focus.  As with many rallying cries, the term is
not well defined.  For some writers, DSS simply mean interactive systems
for use by managers.  To others, the key issue is support, rather than
system.  They focus on understanding and improving the decision process;
a DSS is then designed using any available and suitable technology. Some
researchers view DSS as a subfield of MIS, while others regard it as an
extension of Management Science techniques.  The former define Decision
Support as providing managers with access to data and the latter as giving
them access to analytic models.

    The key argument of this paper is that the term DSS is relevant to
situations where a "final" system can be developed only through an
adaptive process of learning and evolution.  The design strategy must
then focus on getting finished; this is very different from Management
Science and Data Processing approaches.  The research issued for DSS
center around adaption and evolution; they include managerial learning
representation of tasks and user behavior, design architecture and
strategies for getting started.

Using an Online Microfiche Catalog for Technical Service and Retrieval of

    A prototype system is created that integrates a microfiche catalog
into an online computer system for bibliographic control.  Costs and
operational data are collected and analyzed.  The system permits the more
economical microfiche storage of catalog records than would be feasible
for comparable online magnetic disk storage.  Experimental tests
demonstrate the feasibility of the online microfiche catalog system for use
in library technical services and retrieval of bibliographic data.  The
primary result of the project is the creation of a completely operational
facility, including all equipment, software, procedures, and data bases
necessary to demonstrate the system.  A second set of results is derived
from the experimental use of the system and the evaluation of costs and
times for various operations.  The cost effectiveness of the online microfiche
catalog is demonstrated.

including the relational calculus, relational algebra, and SEQUEL.
Numerous examples pertinent to information retrieval are presented in these
relational languages.  Advantages of the relational approach to information

    Approximate matching of strings is reviewed with the aim of
surveying techniques suitable for finding an item in a database when
there may be a spelling mistake or other error in the keyword.  The
methods found are classified as either equivalence or similarity problems.
Equivalence problems are seen to be readily solved using canonical forms.
For similarity problems difference measures are surveyed, with a full
description of the well-established dynamic programming method relating
this to the approach using probabilities and likelihoods.  Searches for
approximate matches in large sets using a difference function are seen to
be an open problem still, though several promising ideas have been
suggested.  Approximate matching (error correction) during parsing is
